  <h3>My bio from LinkedIn</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Ian “Gerard” Shaughnessy; I am born and raised in St. Louis City. I have military, sales, and photography backgrounds and I have been a professional photographer for over 5 years. I am an aspiring full-stack developer at Savvy Coders and I have a Bachelor's in Entrepreneurship from Webster University.

  Growing up, I always knew I wanted to be in the military.  I joined the navy with the intention of working on submarines and doing the work nobody wanted to do.  My service ended early due to medical complications but the lessons I learned have made me into a “battle hardened" worker ready to take on the world.

  <br>Currently, I am a photographer.  I have had a camera in my hands since I was a kid, the device always fascinated me.  I started taking photos for people in 2015, high-school, but did not earn my first dollar with this skill until my sophomore year in college.  Photography has taken me all around the midwest; for live events such as concerts and speeches, prominent people in St. Louis and Columbia, real estate, conventions, charities, weddings, engagements, office parties, and of course: Portraits!  My claim to fame is working for the Angel Band Project, an absolute beast of a non-profit organization, and when they spoke at the United Nations, one of my photos was used during the speech!

  <br>I always intend to have a camera on me, no matter the job I do.  I have met the most amazing people in my life through this skill and I intend to do the same thing with computer programming.

  As I said before, I am aspiring to be a full-stack developer.  I want to take my career in a direction where I can work with mobile applications involving cameras; front end or back end.  5-10 years from now, I would like to own my own business where I can take all the things I love and create something that makes the world better.

  What I am willing to bring to any future employer is discipline, creativity, and a smile into the work place.  Because of this, I believe I can impact any business in a positive way.

  <br>Thank you for taking the time to read about me, have a blessed day!
